# Project Overview 
This repository is for the 4th project of the Udacity FEND Nanodegree, the starter code provided mocks a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. All code, except for the test suit, was provided by Udacity; a basic test suit was already included but no tests were provided.

## Dependencies
Needed to run:
gulp 4.0.0
jasmine 3.3.1
puppeteer 1.11.0
gulp-jasmin-browser 4.1.0

Used during production:
browser-sync: "^2.24.6"

## How to run
You need to have node.js installed as well as the aforementioned dependencies (browser-sync is optional, if you want to use it you can run using "sync" from the console).

To launch the test suit simply run index.html on the browser.

The spec file is in tests/spec/extraSpec.js
The application script is in the js directory.

This repository is part of the requirements for obtaining the nanodegree and its a representation of my skills at the time of writing, as such, I  most likely will not accept pull requests. However, comments and suggestions on how to improve are welcomed and encouraged.
